# Contributing Style Guide

HashiCorp has some [community guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines)
to ensure our public forums are a safe space for everyone. When contributing 
to Vagrant, please respect the same guidelines.

## Getting started with contributions

There are plenty of things to work on in Vagrant, not limited to writing 
software. This includes:

* Fixing documentation for accuracy
* Fixing documentation for grammar and punctuation
* Finding bugs and submitting detailed issues
* Fixing or adding plugins
* Squashing bugs!

When looking through the [Vagrant issue tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues)
for a good first issue, it may be useful to filter by tags. For example, the
[`needs-community-help`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/needs-community-help),
[`needs-repro`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/needs-repro), or
[`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/good-first-issue)
tags.

Once you have found a good issue, you might want to get a development installation 
working. Follow the instructions for [installing from source](/docs/installation/source) 
in order to setup a development environment.

## Submitting your first pull request

When submitting your first pull request to Vagrant make sure you have 
completed the following steps:

* You have written tests for the changes made
* You have run the test suite using `bundle exec rake` and all tests pass
* You have written a descriptive commit message
* Reference the issue the pull requests resolves if applicable
